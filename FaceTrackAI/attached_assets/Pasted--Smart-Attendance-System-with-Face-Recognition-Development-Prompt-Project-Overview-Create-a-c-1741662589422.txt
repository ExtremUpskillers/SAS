## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- Students table: id, name, registration_date, status
- FaceEncodings table: student_id, encoding_data, created_at
- Attendance table: id, student_id, timestamp, session_id, status
- Sessions table: id, name, date, start_time, end_time
- Users table: id, username, password_hash, role, last_login

### API Services
1. Student Registration Service
   - RegisterStudent: Capture and store student data with face encoding
   - UpdateStudent: Modify existing student information
   - DeleteStudent: Remove student data

2. Attendance Service
   - MarkAttendance: Process face recognition and record attendance
   - BulkMarkAttendance: Process multiple students at once
   - ManualAttendance: Allow manual overrides

3. Reporting Service
   - GenerateReport: Create attendance reports based on filters
   - ExportReport: Save reports in different formats
   - AnalyzeAttendance: Calculate statistics and insights

### File Organization
- /src: Frontend HTML, CSS, JavaScript files
- /backend: Python services for face recognition
- /main.js: Electron main process
- /preload.js: Preload script for Electron
- /data: Database and storage directory

### Workflow Logic
1. *Registration Flow*:
   - Capture multiple face images in different angles
   - Generate and store face encodings
   - Validate student information
   - Confirm successful registration

2. *Attendance Flow*:
   - Continuous face detection in camera feed
   - Face recognition against stored encodings
   - Threshold-based matching decision
   - Real-time feedback on recognition status
   - Store attendance records with timestamps

3. *Reporting Flow*:
   - Query attendance records based on filters
   - Generate statistical summaries
   - Create visualizations of attendance patterns
   - Export formatted reports

## Development Challenges to Address
1. *Face Recognition Accuracy*:
   - Handle varying lighting conditions
   - Account for facial changes (glasses, facial hair, etc.)
   - Optimize recognition thresholds

2. *Performance Optimization*:
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of face encodings
   - Batch processing for multiple faces
   - Memory management for large datasets

3. *Privacy and Security*:
   - Secure storage of biometric data
   - Consent management
   - Data retention policies

4. *Usability*:
   - Intuitive user interface
   - Clear feedback on system status
   - Accessible design principles
